Title: My Test Post
Author: kiel
Tags: development

This is the body text of the post.  It consists of a stream of characters
that ultimately terminate in a single line with END written out.

You can create new paragraphs by hitting Enter twice.  Formatting is done
by the Markdown library, so you can write out posts that way.

And this is the point where we come to an end.
