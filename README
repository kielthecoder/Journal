Journal is a no-frills blogging platform written in Python.  It's well-suited for programmers or other developers who don't want to dig through extensive customizations.

It used to power my blog at http://www.kielthecoder.com/ (have since switched back to Wordpress).

INITIAL SETUP

Once you've cloned this repository, you'll need to setup a Python 3 environment for the server.  Typically, you can do something like:

	virtualenv env

in your working directory to create the environment.  Activate the environment in your shell with:

	source env/bin/activate

then install the packages necessary for Journal to run:

	pip install cherrypy jinja2 markdown

TESTING

You will need to create a database for the application.  The db/schema.sql script will create a database suitable for testing.  Create it with:

	cd db ; sqlite3 test.db < schema.sql ; cd ..

RUNNING THE SERVER

Start the server with:

	python server/journal.py

By default, your journal is now accessible from 127.0.0.1:8080.  If you've configured Nginx to proxy requests to the server, you can view your journal by accessing the root URL.
